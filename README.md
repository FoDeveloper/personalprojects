# personalprojects
Hello! Please find a list of my personal projects, consisting of basic web templates, JS code and more!

This particular project is my first ever attempt building a web template "landing page", from structuring the html and styling the elements to make it look pretty. I also added a few images that are special / sentimental to me.

Enjoy!
