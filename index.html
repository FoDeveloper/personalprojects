                Welcome to my first webpage.

            <div class="bio-section-left-minor">
                This webpage is structured with basic HTML and CSS, especially FlexBox.
                I've included some pictures from my travel experiences as well to demonstrate different CSS flexbox layouts.
                I hope you enjoy. Thanks!

            Take a peek at some of my travels below.
            Resize the webpage a bit, look at how the images shrink and
            grow, notice the rounded borders on the images, and how the text wraps as the webpage gets smaller. 
            All these details were programmed by yours truly. Enjoy!
